# Kitchsafe: An Unattended Kitchen Equipment Detection System
 
This project can detect unattended kitchen equipment before it potentially becomes dangerous. The project uses a raspberry pi infrared sensor to monitor a room. If the Python algorithm determined kitchen appliances were unattended, then an alarm would be triggered and a notification would be sent via a mobile app. The mobile app can also be used to set up the system and change default settings for a more customized experience.
